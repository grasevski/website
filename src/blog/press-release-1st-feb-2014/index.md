**BlueBottles–new solar, wind and wave powered autonomous drones that ‘live’ at sea.**

*   Ocius Technology Limited, formerly known as award winning marine technology company SolarSailor, is working with the University of Wollongong to build a series of new types of Uncrewed Surface Vessel (**USV**) called “BlueBottles”.
*   Robert Dane CEO of OCIUS said:

“_Conventional methods for data collection such as ships, buoys, air surveillance and satellites have limitations to give 24/7/365 coverage on, in and below the water –but it is possible now to do it in a new way – using USVs.”_

*   Autonomous USV technologies are in their infancy. **_Bluebottles have between two and twenty five times more speed, power, payload and data rates compared to any other autonomous USVs In the marketplace._**
*   Robert Dane CEO of OCIUS said:  

“_The oceans are the Earth’s lungs. They make oxygen and absorb CO2. They cover 70% of our planet, provide vital transport routes and drive weather, temperature and climate – ultimately supporting all life._”

*   The globaldemandfor data is directly proportional to all the information and intelligence gathering requiredby authorities for border protection,security, oceanography, defence, hydrography, fisheries and oil and gas.
*   The market for USVs for the defence industry alone is estimated to be US$3.8 Billion over the next 7 years[[1]](#_ftn1). Characteristics identified in the USV defence market are endurance, payload, coverage and low capital cost. Such a USV is described as ‘disruptive’. Bluebottles have these characteristics.
*   Like their namesake,Bluebottles ‘live’ at sea usingenergyavailable at sea.
*   Bluebottles have a low cost/byte data compared to conventional methods and current USV drones.
*   Bluebottlesare self-deploying and self-retrieving -requiring no anchors/chains or ships.
*   BlueBottlescan roam widely or stay on station for months to years.
*   Bluebottles require no fuel, no crew and no supplies.
*   Bluebottles can provide a large stable platform for sensors and payloads for above and below surface monitoring and surveillance, and communications linking subsea monitors and vessels, surface vessels, aerial vehicles and satellites.
*   Bluebottles can work in a network and play simultaneous roles reducing costs even further.
*   Bluebottles are planned by Ocius to be mass-produced in Australia.

Australia’s Ocius is at the forefront in this new multi billion-dollarworldwide industry.
