Last month Solar Sailor and Forgacs Engineering launched a prototype for the worldâ€™s first Unmanned Ocean Vessels (UOVs) powered by renewable energy.

These will provide governments and organizations with a vessel that can spend an unlimited amount of time at sea using wind and solar energy. This offers benefits to coastal surveillance, national security, meteorology and marine science.
