The Ocius team have further tested Bruce’s navigational capabilities on Botany Bay to great success.

Robert Dane said:

> “Figure 8 sailing at a waypoint is really valuable as the boat is ‘gybing’ at each end so a towed sensor is always trailing properly. We can set the sweep legs to anything from 500m – 5 miles and we stay on station with very little energy, mainly moving sail and rudder at each end.”
