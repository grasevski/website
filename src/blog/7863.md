Following our AGM on Tuesday, 27th November, 2018 as well as celebrating OCIUS’ success at the recent Wargames, the team from OCIUS, shareholders and special guests cheered as Blanche d’Alpuget christened our next generation Bluebottle “BOB” in honour of our ex-Chairman, the Honourable Bob Hawke AC.

“So here, today,” said Blanche, “we have a history-making robot that will revolutionalise our relationship with the biggest thing on our planet: the sea. All of us gathered here this afternoon may henceforth claim the privilege of having been present when history was made, for we have before us one of the most remarkable inventions of the 21st century”.
