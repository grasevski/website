Yesterday on 11 July, while OCIUS engineers met government and Royal Australian Navy representatives at our base station at Hyams Beach, 18′ Bluebottle prototype Bruce was set a mission of 65 waypoints over 1.5 hours to draw the letters RAN in the ocean.

CEO Robert Dane said “Bluebottle ocean drones have the performance, power and control to accurately do this….and do it in an environmentally friendly way, using no fossil fuels or creating any waste. It is just using the power out there on the surface of the ocean – solar, wind and wave energy.”
