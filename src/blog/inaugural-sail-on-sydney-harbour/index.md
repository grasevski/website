### Blue Nemo had a successful sail on Sydney Harbour last week with blue skies and some steady winds. Picture above shows Ocius 2.8m USV on part tack in light-moderate winds on Sydney Harbour.

The vessel was able to put through its paces in all its modes of power from sailing across the harbour to propelling itself passively with its wave oscillators. The active propulsion system also allowed the vessel to test its ability to move from quickly from one waypoint to another and manoeuvre in busy traffic.
