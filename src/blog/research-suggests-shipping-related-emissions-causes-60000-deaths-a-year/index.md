A recent paper in _Environmental Science and Technology,_ called [‘Mortality from Ship Emissions: A Global Assessment’](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/es071686z) suggests that shipping-related emissions are responsible for approximately 60,000 cardiopulmonary and lung cancer deaths annually, with most deaths occurring near coastlines in Europe, East Asia, and South Asia.

Epidemiological studies consistently link ambient concentrations of particulate matter (PM) to negative health impacts, including asthma, heart attacks, hospital admissions, and premature mortality.

The report estimates mortalities by modelling emissions increases due to ships and applying these to cancer concentration-risk functions. Under current regulation, and with the expected growth in shipping activity, the report estimates that annual mortalities could increase by 40% before 2012.
