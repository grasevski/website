Bluebottle prototype ‘Nemo’ V 1.2 sailing autonomously on Botany Bay. While Ocius engineers sat calmy on the shore, Nemo performed autonomous ‘sailing squares’ on Botany Bay, including auto-tacking on upwind legs.

Ocius engineers, Lloyd Breckenridge and Matt McGill, changed missions alternatively via 900 megahertz radio frequency (RF) and 4G mobille phone comms from a host station situated on the shore. After 4 hours they then took over and drove Nemo manually back to the wharf using live camera feed.
