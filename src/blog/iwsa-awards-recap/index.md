#### Ocius and CEO, Robert Dane, recently attended the International Wind-ship Association Awards ceremony as finalists in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[Wind Propulsion Innovation Award and Lifetime Achievement Award](http://ec2-13-210-89-186.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com/2016/07/wind-propulsion-innovation-award/)</span>, respectively. The Awards recognise pioneering projects and technological innovation in the development of wind propulsion for technically and commercially viable solutions for the shipping industry.

In the Lifetime Achievement Award, Robert was pleased to present our achievements but the award went to Bernd Wagner – for the Dyna Rig. Bernd, at eighty years of age was a worthy recipient, his research on square sailing rigs dating back to the 1960’s.

In the Technology User Award, thank you to all who voted and especially to Connor McLeod in our marketing department! Over 4000 votes were recorded among the major categories. The award went to E ships with the most votes, Ocius as runner up. Being nominated in this category was a great acknowledgement of Ocius’ achievements. As the IWSA attests, all of the companies nominated in this category are taking practical steps to tackle some of the wind propulsion sector’s greatest opportunities and challenges. This group are all working to achieve a vision of an industry in which sustainability equals success.
