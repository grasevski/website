_Bruce’s_ testing continues on Sydney’s Botany Bay this May with a range of new features being implemented on board and remotely.

Software Engineer Matt McGill said “It’s been almost 6 months since _Bruce’s_ maiden voyage. After a few teething problems that have now been resolved, _Bruce_ is now undergoing assorted sea trials.”

Senior Systems Engineer Lloyd Breckenridge said “Integration testing with Thales’ on board systems has commenced and at the same time _Bruce_ is getting many hours of endurance testing. Collision avoidance software development is progressing as scheduled and testing the progress can be quite exciting.”
