OCIUS Chief Executive Robert Dane today announced the appointment of Peter Wlodarczyk as Lead Engineer. He was previously Section Leader of Applied Research of ResMed.

Graduating from the University of Newcastle with a BE (Computer Engineering), Mr Woldarczyk has over 20 years experience as a systems/software engineer in defense, IT and medical device industries.

For the last 15 years he has worked for ResMed as a software engineer, system engineer and researcher innovating new products for sleep apnea and respiratory failure. He has since developed a keen interest in UAVs, leading a team that successfully completed the 2014 UAV Challenge Outback Rescue competition run by the CSIRO and Queensland University of Technology.
