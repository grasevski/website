### Solar Sailor are proud to have won the award for the Environmental Technology category in the Sustainable Shipping Award 2010.

**Acceptance speech by Anna Richardson – Solar Sailor representative**

“Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Thank you so much. Robert Dane, CEO of Solar Sailor could not be here tonight as in less than 6 hours, he will be attending the official launch of the first of four hybrid solar sailor boats in Hong Kong. He has asked me to say what a great honour this is and thank the judges and Sustainable Shipping awards. We would also like to thank the Australian government for their support.

We proudly invite everyone in the marine community to come to Hong Kong and ride on the new ferries – the world’s first parallel hybrid electric solar ferry service. The boats are saving 50% fuel compared to old boats. This comes from a combination of the hybrid technology, solar and lightweight design.

The solarsail technology has a number of applications from small unmanned vessels to bulkers – Solar Sailor has recently strengthened its product offering in the lucrative super yacht sector through a technical alliance with the super yacht consultants Royale Oceanic who are here tonight.”

**About the Sustainable Shipping Awards**

Over 150 experts involved in the maritime sector gathered at the Sustainable Shipping awards in London on 24th June at The Cumberland Hotel, London to celebrate those companies making great strides to shape and improve the environmental legacy of shipping.

The Sustainable Shipping Awards dinner was preceded in the afternoon with an exhibition of the shortlisted award nominees along with a forum hosted by The Carbon War Room Shipping Operation entitled: ‘Unlocking The Barriers to Investment in Eco Efficient Marine Technology’.

Both the exhibition and the interactive forum gave real opportunities to showcase the entries in-depth as well as allowing discussion and key networking amongst both guests and nominees prior to the awards dinner.

The awards ceremony was opened by José Maria Figueres, former President of Costa Rica and chairman of the Carbon War Room, who spoke of the challenges faced by the industry, the efforts being made and the importance of the Sustainable Shipping awards.

Chairman of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Marine Environment Committee (MEPC), Andreas Chrysostomou, then led the proceedings, acting as master of ceremonies.

The winners were decided by a group of internationally respected industry figures that included Dr Anne-Marie Warris, environmental adviser at Lloyd’s Register, Arild B Iversen, president and CEO of Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics, Arthur Bowring, managing director of Hong Kong Shipowners Association, Charlie Brown from IKEA, Fred Pearce, environmental journalist, Lars Robert Pedersen from BIMCO, Dr Simon Walmsley from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Natalie Bruckner-Menchelli, senior editor of SustainableShipping.com.

The second annual Sustainable Shipping awards are to recognise those people who have dedicated their time and money to helping shipping reduce its carbon footprint, and to encourage others to get involved.
