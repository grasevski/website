Australian knowledge powers Hong Kong’s cleaner, greener ferry fleet

Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC) today launched the first of four new hybrid-powered passenger ferries using technology developed in Australia.

Twenty-four metres long and carrying up to 100 people, the Solar Sailor vessel will comprise part of a cleaner, greener fleet that will transport passengers to the HKJC’s Kau Sai Chau Public Golf Course.

Using solar-collecting cells to power a hybrid diesel-electric engine, the technology was developed by Australian-based Solar Sailor, a leading innovator in maritime solar technology.

A local shipyard is building the ferries using Solar Sailor’s design and expertise.  
One of the vessels will have “moveable” sails to help it harness the maximum amount of solar energy. Other designs allow these solar sails to harvest both sun and wind energy to make Solar Sailor vessels even more energy efficient.

Australian Consul-General, Mr Les Luck, said today’s launch represented the first commercial application of the innovative hybrid-power ferries in Hong Kong.  
“Australia’s new Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, yesterday reaffirmed Australia’s commitment to supporting emerging energy technologies to reduce the world’s reliance on carbon emission-producing energy sources,” said Mr Luck.

“These ferries are a shining example of how Australians are already contributing to the desire for a cleaner global environment,” he said.

The transport industry accounts for as much as 20 percent of global greenhouse emissions.

Advantages of the hybrid solar-powered sea vessels include fuel savings, zero emission capability, power redundancy, reduced greenhouse, noxious gas and particle emissions, and potential access to environmentally sensitive routes.

Another of Solar Sailor’s environmentally friendly hybrid-powered vessels was recently launched in Shanghai to carry VIP passengers to World Expo along the Huangpu River.

Sydney’s harbour has been running a hybrid Solar Sailor ship since 2000.
