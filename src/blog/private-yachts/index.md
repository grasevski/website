SolarSails and HMP together in harmony on a private yacht. In 2010, SolarSailor joined forces with Alastair Callender, a student at Coventry University in the UK to design a concept supergreen superyacht incorporating SolarSails and HMP technology together. The result was the 58m Soliloquy which won several awards and industry acclaim.
