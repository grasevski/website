Solar Sailor has won the Australian Design Award for the Engineering Design category for 2000 – 2001.

UTS collaborated in the design of the high efficiency electric motors for marine applications. The motors have only one moving part and high torque enabling direct drive to the propeller without the need for a gearbox.

The motors were one of the three reasons Solar Sailor stated as representing design excellence in order to win the award. Solar Sailor has exceeded the operator’ expectations and received universal positive feedback from customers.

Over 50 expressions of interest have been received in the product for the tourism, eco-tourism and passenger transport markets.
