Ocius is excited to announce the establishment of its European office, located at the award-winning Future Business Centre in Cambridge (UK).

The company has also formed a wholly owned UK limited company (Ocius Technology UK Ltd) to better facilitate investment and contracts within Europe.

Cambridge is an ideal location for Ocius. It is a world-recognised centre for technological innovation, advanced engineering and venture finance.The office is headed by William Greene, a trusted partner and corporate adviser with long standing expertise in clean industrial technologies.

European operations will be focused initially on the R.O.P.S. technology, taking advantage of close proximity to the â‚¬56bn EU shipping industry. Shipping is facing stringent IMO and EU environmental regulations combined with highly volatile bunker fuel prices. These are driving large investments into environmental technologies, particularly in European shipyards.

The office will also provide an important base for reaching out to partners and customers for the Ocius USV system as products gets ready for launch in late 2015.
