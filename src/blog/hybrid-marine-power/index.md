SolarSailor HMP

Like a hybrid car, Hybrid Marine Power combines the efficiency and torque of electric motors with the power and range of internal combustion engines. In a marine environment, there is abundant renewable energy from the sun and wind which SolarSailor uses to provide:

1.  Fuel and financial savings
2.  Environmental savings
3.  Functional redundancy
4.  ‘Zero emission mode’

SolarSailor’s HMP™ has:

*   Demonstrated ability in [real world vessels](http://solarsailor.com/showroom/)
*   Fully marine authority approved
*   Flexibility to run electric systems from main diesel engines, generators, batteries, solar and/or wind power
*   Professional software to control and service
*   Includes, commissioning and warranty
*   24 hour support

SolarSailor designs both **‘series hybrid’** (all-electric drive with generators and solar supplying electricity to the batteries) and **‘parallel hybrid’** (internal combustion engines and electric motors can drive the propeller).
