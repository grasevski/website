The Defence Innovation Hub has awarded $1.7 million to Ocius, in order to “determine the viability of an intelligent command and control network of persistent unmanned surface vessels”.

> CEO Robert Dane said, “This is a significant contract. We’ll build a network of unmanned surface vessels that are intelligent and persistent. The aim is to work with NAVY and Primes to demonstrate applications and payloads that these relatively low cost assets, with continuous presence and no humans in harms way can augment capability for ADF and Australia’s Home Affairs.

The technology is intended to improve Defence maritime services, like patrols, mine clearance, environmental monitoring and search and rescue operations.

Minister for Defence Industry Steven Ciobo said the government is investing in innovation to support a smarter and stronger Australian Defence Force in order to keep the country safe and secure.

“The latest tranche of investments, funded through the Defence Innovation Hub, demonstrates the government’s commitment to invest in Australian industry, universities and research organisations to deliver leading-edge capability for Defence,” Minister Ciobo said.
