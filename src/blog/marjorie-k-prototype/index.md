### The prototype Marjorie K was built in the Solar Sailor factory in Ulladulla, Australia.

A few facts about the Solar Sailor prototype:  
* It was built in 82 days;  
* It was built from a modified Hobie 20 hull with extensions added;  
* The solar wings are made from foam sandwich, fibreglass/carbon fibre composite;  
* The maximum combined output from all solar arrays is 3200 Watts or 4.3 horsepower.  
* The wings operate by a simple lever and pulley system. For the proposed ferry design the wings will use gears, hydraulics and microprocessor control.
