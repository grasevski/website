BLUEBOTTLE USV _BRUCE_ DEMONSTRATES WAYPOINT AND LINE FOLLOWING ACCURACY

On 28th June Bluebottle USV prototype _Bruce_ demonstrated an autonomous mission of greater than 60 waypoints and tracking virtual lines with accuracy of better than 10m.

Senior Systems Engineer Lloyd Breckenridge said:

“We’ve completed and exceeded all our enclosed waterway trials on Jervis Bay. We are starting ocean testing mid July leading up to our demonstration with Thales’s thin line array to NAVY mid August.”
