Dear Friends, Shareholders and Colleagues of Ocius,

On Friday 18th of June, the last three Bluebottle USVs in the current set of five were christened at our factory on the UNSW Randwick Campus. 

We were honoured to have RADM Pete Quinn, Senator Holly Hughes standing in for Hon Melissa Price and longtime Ulladulla shareholder Michelle Moulos christen the boats.
