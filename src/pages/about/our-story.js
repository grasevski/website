            Ocius Technology Ltd (formerly Solar Sailor Holdings Ltd) is an Australian public
            unlisted company with Research and Development facilities at the University of NSW.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 1997, Solar Sailor won the Advanced Technology Boat Race in Canberra, beating the
            next solar boat by 5 laps of 6km (30km) using a new patented &apos;solar sail&apos; - a
            simple device which harnesses both solar and wind energy in a seaworthy manner.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since then, the company has proven a solid track record of conceiving, funding, and
            delivering difficult, innovative, high-tech, award-winning projects on time and on
            budget.
          </p>

          <p>
            The company has built multiple &apos;solarsailor&apos; prototypes and six high-tech,
            award winning, hybrid electric, commercial passenger ferries to international
            classification requirements, which together have carried tens of thousands of
            passengers. Today, four solarsailor hybrid electric ferries operated by the Hong Kong
            Jockey Club operate 364 days of year, 14 hours a day, from Sai Kung to Kau Sai Chau half
            the fuel ferries.
          </p>

          <p>
            Following an enquiry from the USA in 2007 for a &apos;platform that could go to sea
            forever&apos;, the company began research into the development of unmanned
            solar/wind/wave powered ocean vessels or autonomous unmanned surface vessels. Initially,
            a 20-foot manned engineering development model (EDM) proved the &apos;speed of
            advance&apos; in all conditions, adequate power, payload and persistence for a
            sustainable platform go to sea for months.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2014, Solar Sailor changed its name to OCIUS (Latin for &apos;fleet&apos;) to reflect
            an expansion of its patented technologies and a pivot in direction for the company.
          </p>

          <p>
            OCIUS built multiple scale models for tank and lake testing, culminating in the building
            of the first 10&apos; prototype called &apos;Nemo&apos; (Latin for &apos;no one&apos; ie
            unmanned) which provided significant proof of concept of a solar, wind and wave powered
            USV carrying a significant payload.
          </p>

          <p>
            Based on Nemo&apos;s development, in 2015, OCIUS was awarded a Capability Technology
            Demonstrator (CTD) from Defence Science and Technology Group. This proved a significant
            contract and OCIUS with our partner Thales developed an 18&apos; prototype
            &apos;Bruce&apos; for Antisubmarine Warfare (ASW), which was demonstrated to the NAVY in
            August 2017.
          </p>

          <p>
            In Sept 2018, Ocius was awarded its second defence contract under the Defence Innovation
            Hub to build an intelligent “Command and Control (C2) network” of intelligent persistent
            unmanned surface vessels.
          </p>

          <p>
            In November 2019 &apos;Bruce&apos; participated Autonomous Warrior War games in Jervis
            Bay. Due to extreme weather, &apos;Bruce&apos; was often the only USV operating.
            Ocius&apos; intelligent C2 system was used to control another Navy WAMV catamaran and 2
            DSTG UUVs.
          </p>

          <p>
            From May - June 2019, Ocius completed 6 week endurance and intelligent networking trials
            in a designated AMSA approved &apos;box&apos; off the NSW Coast, successfully completing
            the DIH contract 3 months ahead of schedule.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ocius is continuing its work with Thales, testing a new Thales thin line array deployed
            from the Bluebottle keel winch to significant and varying depths, which is being
            demonstrated at Pacific 2019 Expo at Darling Harbour 8-10 October.
          </p>

          <strong>Commercial Ferries</strong>
          <p>
            Solar Sailor built 6 commercial solar sailor vessels providing valuable experience to
            OCIUS on the commercial maritime and technical applications of its technology as well as
            developing an extensive network of first-class suppliers and partners.

              In July 2008, with oil at $140/ barrel, the Hong Kong Jockey Club ordered the
              construction of four&nbsp;
              <a href="/120116-b4-solarsails-outbound-at-sai-kung.jpg">commuter ferries</a>
              &nbsp;to operate a service to transport players, staff and supplies from the mainland
              at Sai Kung to the island of Kau Sai Chau where the HKJC has three 18 hole golf
              courses. The ferries alternate two routes of five and seven mile round trips with slow
              sectors at each end in a 20-minute cycle. Solar Sailor modelling predicted substantial
              savings in fuel consumption compared to the previous ‘standard’ diesel ferry service,
              as well as reductions in emissions.&nbsp; The boats in operation have exceeded this
              since in independent tests since delivery and are still running 14 hours a day, seven
              days a week using half the fuel of the previous ferries.

            <strong>Unmanned Surface Vessels</strong>
            <br />
            Following an enquiry from the USA in 2007 for a ‘self-sustaining platform at sea’, OCIUS
            began research into the development of unmanned solar/wind/wave and ballasted powered
            ocean vessels or autonomous unmanned surface vessels. Initially, a 20 foot&nbsp;manned
            engineering development model (EDM) proved the &apos;speed of advance&apos; in all
            conditions, adequate power, payload and persistence for a sustainable platform able to
            go to sea for months.

          <p>
            In 2014, Solar Sailor changed its name to OCIUS (Latin for &apos;fleet&apos;) to reflect
            an expansion of its patented technologies including the solar sail. With Ulladulla
            Fibreglass and Engineering, OCIUS built multiple scale models for tank and lake testing,

            Demonstrator (CTD) from Defence Science and Technology Group. This proved a significant
            contract and OCIUS with our partners developed an 18&apos; prototype &apos;Bruce&apos;
            for Antisubmarine Warfare (ASW), which demonstrated to NAVY in August 2017.
